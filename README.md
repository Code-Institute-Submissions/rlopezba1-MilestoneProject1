# Lighthouse Lawers

The Lighthouse Lawers project is the website of a law firm offering legal consulting services.
The presentation is relaxed, without too many ornaments, focused on user action.
There are 4 links, the home page, the presentation of the lawyers, the specialties, and the contact form.

## UX
This website is for people who have a legal problem and are looking at different options.
When they get to this website, they can see a relaxed website so as not to worry them more, 
but at the same time with a direct message of help and action so that the user can free themselves and move forward.

## Features
In this section, I go over the different parts of my project, and describe each.

### Home
When they enter the main page and click the button, a modal opens for them to give us the data so we do not lose contact details. The main page sends messages of calm but invites to action.
Messages like "Free consultation" or "No fees until we win" or "call Us" with the ease of calling instantly.

### Our team

Here you can see the members of the firm, serious and professional image,
with an explanation of their skills and experience

### Practice area

Different specialties of the firm so that the client can clearly see what the firm is an expert in.

### Contact us

extensive contact form, with a map of the location of the company so that the client can see exactly where they are.


### Existing Features
#### Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

#### Features Left to Implement

## Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

* Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
* Different configuration files?
* Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
